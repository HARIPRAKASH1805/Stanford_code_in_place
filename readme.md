# Stanford_code_in_place - 2021(May to June)
##Code in Place
A free, human-centric, intro-to-coding course in the time of COVID-19
Is this the course with the most teachers ever? In 2020, at the start of the pandemic, as an act of community service over 900 teachers from around the world came 
together to offer a first-of-its-kind volunteer-led course called Code in Place, hosted by Stanford University. Code in Place was a great, uplifting, 
learning experience and over 10,000 students learned how to code in python. It was such a good time we are going to do it again in April 2021. The courses are finished, 
but we might have future offerings.
